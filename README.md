# API-Gateway-With-Auth-Server
In this repository, I have added Api Gateway and Auth Server, which are modularized and well integrated. They can be integrated in Microservice based architecture like plug and play.

The "API-Gateway With Auth Server" repository is a comprehensive solution that combines an API gateway and an authentication server in a modular and integrated manner. It provides a seamless and plug-and-play integration of these two critical components, enabling efficient and secure communication between client applications and the backend microservices.

The API gateway serves as a centralized entry point for all incoming requests, providing a unified interface and managing the routing, load balancing, and traffic control for the various microservices. It acts as a protective shield for the microservices by enforcing security policies, rate limiting, and request validation.

The authentication server, on the other hand, handles the crucial task of user authentication, authorization, and access control. It provides robust authentication mechanisms, such as token-based authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), session management, and user credential verification. By integrating the authentication server with the API gateway, the repository ensures that all incoming requests are authenticated and authorized before being forwarded to the respective microservices.

The modular and well-integrated nature of this repository allows developers to easily incorporate and configure the API gateway and authentication server components into their own projects. The plug-and-play capability enables quick setup and integration, saving valuable development time and effort. Additionally, the repository may provide configuration examples, documentation, and best practices to guide developers in utilizing and customizing the API gateway and authentication server components to suit their specific application requirements.

Overall, the "API-Gateway With Auth Server" repository offers a robust and scalable solution for building secure, efficient, and well-structured microservices architectures, enabling seamless communication between client applications and backend services while ensuring strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
